This exam is the same format as the notebooks we have been completing in class.
Like the notebooks, you can access the data and exam itself by running the 
script found in **notebook00.Rmd** anytime after 4pm on the day the exam is
posted.

### Instructions

1. In each section there is exactly one object, data set, or visualization that
you need to create. Make sure that tables and graphic prints out in the knit
file.

2. There are nine questions on this exam. Each is worth 10 points. An 
additional 5 points is assigned based on your code formatting across the
entire exam. 

3. You must submit two files: the Rmarkdown file and a knit version of the
file as an HTML document. These must be uploaded to Box by the deadline. Note
that these will not preview correctly on Box, so be careful when uploading.

4. You may use any static resources, such as course notes and external
websites, but you may not discuss the exam with classmates anyone else.

5. I am happy to answer clarifying questions about the exam or to help you
with unexpected R errors. However, I will not answer content-based questions 
after the exam is posted. Note that I may not be able to answer questions 
sent after noon the day the exam is due.

6. The exam should take no more than 3 hours, but you may use as much time 
as you need.

7. Personal computer issues is not an excuse for not completing the exam on
time. As a back up, you can use the computers in the Jepson computer lab or
in the library. 

Good luck!
