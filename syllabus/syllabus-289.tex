\bigskip

\textbf{Topics:}
Methods for collecting, manipulating, visualizing, exploring, and presenting
data.

\bigskip

\textbf{Exams:}
There are four take-home, open-book exams. Grades are given out of 95 points.
A follow-up oral exam may be requested, with the potential for an altered grade,
when exam results are significantly divergent from observered in-class
performance.

\bigskip

\textbf{Homework \& Class Forms:}
For homework, students must finish or review the solutions to all in-class work
from the previous class meeting and closely read the notes posted for the
following class. An online form must be submitted at the start of each class
giving a self-report on attendance and homework completion. A grade will be
given based on the percentage of homework assignments completed.

\bigskip

\textbf{Course Reflection:}
An essay reflecting on one's effort and engagement during the semester
is due on the last day of class. A grade will be given out of 95 points.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Grades:}
The exam, homework, and course engagement grades are averaged (1/6th each)
and a letter grade is assigned according to the following:
             A (93--96), A- (90--92),
B+ (87--89), B (83--86), B- (80--82),
C+ (77--79), C (73--76), C- (70--72), and F (0--69).

\bigskip

\textbf{Attendance:}
Coming to class is important, but so is protecting your classmates by staying
home when sick. The course form requests that you explain any absences. If
these become excessive, I will reach out to individuals with a warning and
further details.
