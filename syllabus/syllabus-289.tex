\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Website}: \texttt{https://statsmaths.github.io/dsst289-f21}

\bigskip

\textbf{Topics:}
Methods for collecting, manipulating, visualizing, exploring, and presenting
data.

\bigskip

\textbf{Exams:}
There are four take-home, open-book exams. Grades are given out of 95 points.
A follow-up oral exam may be requested, along with an altered grade, in the case
that the exam results are significantly divergent from observered in-class
performance.

\bigskip

\textbf{Class Forms:}
There is a form (link on website) to submit during each class meeting, even
when absent. A grade is given based entirely on completion, equal to the
percentage of forms submitted within 24-hours of each class.

\bigskip

\textbf{Engagement:}
A short essay reflecting on one's effort and engagement during the semester
is due on the last day of class. A grade will be given out of 95 points.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Grades:}
The exams, class forms, and course engagement grades are averaged (1/6th each)
and a letter grade is assigned according to the following:
             A (93--96), A- (90--92),
B+ (87--89), B (83--86), B- (80--82),
C+ (77--79), C (73--76), C- (70--72), and F (0--69).

\bigskip

\textbf{Other:}
There are no course texts, graded homeworks, or final examination.
