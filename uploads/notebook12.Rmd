## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(smodels)
library(stringi)
library(broom)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
options(pillar.min_character_chars = 15)
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
options(ggrepel.max.overlaps = Inf)
options(width = 85L)
```

## Movies Data

Over the next few classes we will be working with a dataset of movies I have
constructed consisting of the top 100 grossing films for each year from 1970 to
2019. The data comes from IMDb. Today we will focus on getting familiar with
the various components of the data. Let's read in the four tables of data,
as well as a data dictionary, and then go through each of the tables.

```{r, message=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(file.path("data", "movies_50_years.csv"))
m_genre <- read_csv(file.path("data", "movies_50_years_genre.csv"))
m_people <- read_csv(file.path("data", "movies_50_years_people.csv"))
m_dict <- read_csv(file.path("data", "movies_50_years_data_dictionary.csv"))
m_color <- read_csv(file.path("data", "movies_50_years_color.csv"))
```

See the previous notes and the data dictionary for more information about the
available variables.

### Movie People

Summarize the average number of people listed as starring in a film for each
year (first count the number per film and then take the average), and plot the
pattern over the 50 years of data that we have available to us. Do you notice
anything strange about the dataset?

```{r, question-01}

```

Filter the data to those names where the gender confidence score is
less than 0.6. Note any patterns that you see and consider caveats that
any gender-based analysis on the larger dataset should consider.

```{r, question-02}

```

Now, make a plot showing the number of films starring the 20 most prolific
actors with the bars filled according to an actor's gender. Note, consider
grouping the data by both gender and person before doing the summarization.

```{r, question-03}

```

You will (hopefully) notice something strange in the plot above. Fix this by
only including actors with a high gender confidence score (above 0.95 perhaps?).

```{r, question-04}

```

### Movies Table

Start by plotting the average number of ratings (`rating_count`) for each
year of the dataset. What patterns do you notice?

```{r, question-05}

```

It will be helpful for some analyses to have a variable called `decade` in the
dataset, because year may be too grainular to use. In the code below, create a
decade variable using the variable `year` (i.e., 1972 => 1970, 1996 => 1990)
and the function `floor`, which removes the decimal part of the year. Using
floor, you can get decade with a few basic mathematical operations. Once you
are confident your code is correct, add this variable into our copy of the
`movies` dataset.

```{r, question-06}

```

Select the top grossing film from each year. Scroll through the list; how many
of these films do you know (approximately, no need to formally count)?

```{r, question-07}

```

Now, take the 25th highest-gross film in each year (Note: NOT The films 1-25,
just the 25th, so one film per year). How familiar are these? Do
you know some decade better than others?

```{r, question-08}

```

And finally, repeat with the 100th highest gross film in each year. Keep in
mind how common (or not) these films seem to you as we work through the
remainder of the dataset.

```{r, question-09}

```
