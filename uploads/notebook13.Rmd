## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(smodels)
library(stringi)
library(broom)
library(lubridate)
library(jsonlite)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
options(pillar.min_character_chars = 15)
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
options(ggrepel.max.overlaps = Inf)
options(width = 85L)
```

## JSON Data

### Wikipedia Pageviews

We will start by reading in a JSON file that comes from one of the (many) 
Wikipedia APIs. This one returns information about the number of page views
for a give page for the last 60 days. In particular I created one for the 
page "Art".

```{r}
obj <- read_json(file.path("data", "wiki_pageviews_art.json"))
```

We will slowly go through the steps I would use to understand the structure of
this JSON file in R. As an initial step, use the names() function to see if the
root is an Object with names and to see what these names are:

```{r, question-01}

```

Now, using the name you found above, print out the first element of the object
(it should be an empty string):

```{r, question-02}

```

Next, print out the names of the query key from the root Object:

```{r, question-03}

```

Then, grab the first element from within the query key (use the dollar sign and
name, not square brackets). This should show the lower case version of the page
name that I queried and the name of the page as it is capitalized on the site:

```{r, question-04}

```

Now, write the code below to grab the fully capitalized version of the page 
name. This may be slightly more complex than it first seems:

```{r, question-05}

```

Print the names of the pages key that is inside the query key. You should see
that there is only a single name here.

```{r, question-06}

```

The name above corresponds to the page id. Here, unlike above, it is better to
grab the one element of the pages object using the square bracket notation so
that we do not have to change the number if we use a different page. Below,
print out the names of the keys within the specific page (there should be four
of them):

```{r, question-07}

```


The pageid, ns (namespace), and title are scalar values that capture metadata
about the page. The real interesting data is inside the pageviews key. Show all
of the data for the pageviews key below:

```{r, question-08}

```

Now, using the function we learned today, create a dataset using a map_ function
that contains one row for each pageview and three features: the title of the
page, the date of the observation, and the number of views.

```{r, question-09}

```

Repeat the last question, but now create the dataset using a flatten function.

```{r, question-10}

```

## Wikipage

Now, we will move onto a larger dataset. Here, we look at another API call from 
Wikipedia, this time a call that returns the actual content of the page. Again,
we will use the Art page. One element contains a long string of HTML code that
I will remove here for you to avoid crashing RStudio if you accidentally print
it out.

```{r}
obj <- read_json(file.path("data", "wikipage_art.json"))
obj$parse$text <- ""
```

Let's start by looking at the data inside `obj$parse$langlinks`. It gives 
an array of information about links to Wikipedia pages in different languages.
Print out the names of the keys under the first element of the langlinks key
(all the elements have the same names):

```{r, question-11}

```

Now, create a data set that captures all of the information about all of the
language links (one key is called "*", we don't need that). Do include the 
original page title in English.

```{r, question-12}

```


### Wikipedia Pageviews (again)

To finish, we will read in another version of the Wikipedia page views data,
but here for the Literature page. The biggest difference, though, is that the
last day of data is missing (this is normal; in fact, I had to manually enter
the missing value above to not slow us down).

```{r}
obj <- read_json(file.path("data", "wiki_pageviews_literature.json"))
```

Try to figure out how to create a version of the data set that we created above
by dealing with the missing value. Note that you may want to use the functions
`is.null` and `ifelse` (and not if_else; I can explain more why if you would
like).

```{r, question-13}

```
