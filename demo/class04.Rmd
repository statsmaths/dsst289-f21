```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(smodels)
library(gapminder)

theme_set(theme_minimal())

```

Let's create and load the data (we will see more about these functions for
next class):

```{r}
hans <- gapminder::gapminder %>%
  rename(life_exp = lifeExp, gdp = gdpPercap) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(pop = pop / 1000000)

continent_colors <- gapminder::continent_colors
```

And now we'll look at the data:

```{r}
hans
```

Can we recreate the 'basic' plot from the video?

```{r}

```

Now, let's try to get the scales even better:

```{r}

```

And finally, maybe some extra labels using the `labs` function?

```{r}

```
